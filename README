Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
-----------------------------

This is where I'm keeping my solutions to the [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) for future reference. Since I tend to go back and attempt them in other programming languages, I find it helpful to keep the solutions around.

It's important to note that I make no claims as to the quality of this code -- it's written quickly to get to a solution, and it's not intended as an example of production quality coding styles.
